# firststep-I
1st of the firststep series....
tis a simple tic-tac-toe game written in C, which i wrote to learn about multi-dimensional arrays

To play (on Windows):
1. Run the executable named tic-tac-toe.exe
2. (Optional) Resize the window using Ctrl+Scrollwheelup
3. Read the rules before pressing 1
4. Enjoy

PS: if defender has blocked it from running, run it anyway.

To compile (Ubuntu or any compiler really):
1. Download repo and open it in terminal
2. Type these lines

   gcc -o tictactoe main.c
   ./tictactoe

Enjoy the fruit of my overnight labour
